# pcastanedaRestaurantPicker

Program that will randomly generate a restaurant for user to eat at.

Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Immediately off the bat and without looking at the code I entered "euro" thinking it would break or ask for a valid input. I was lowkey shocked it worked. Great catch of a possible edge case! Good overall design. I like that you can quickly generate a second answer if you don't like the first option. Code looks great. String array for data storage was a good call, data validation and play-again are handled properly with while loops, and I especially liked that you made separate functions for each restaurant category. Overall great work!
